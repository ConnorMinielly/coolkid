# A Config ‚öôÔ∏è Tool For Cool Kids Like Me and You üï∂Ô∏è

This is a repo/tool to track all the tools, configs and softwares I use in my Dev environment and day to day work so it's easy to update/reinstall operating systems so on.

Feel free to make recommendations via PRs or throw up Issues if you think I should change my setup. Friends don't let friends use software with well known security exploits or embedded crypto miners right?

One should be able to install/use coolkid with below:

```bash
npm i -g coolkid # Locally install cli
npx coolkid # Run without installing
```

where flag is the thing you're trying to setup.
